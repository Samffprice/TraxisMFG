subheading: "Common questions about our process and capabilities"
faqs:
  - question: "What is your typical lead time for a project?"
    answer: "Our standard production timeline is typically 6 weeks from design approval to delivery. This allows us to dedicate the necessary time and attention to detail that high-precision components demand. For urgent requirements, expedited service may be available depending on project complexity and current capacity."
  - question: "What CAD file formats do you accept for quotes?"
    answer: "We accept all major CAD file formats including STEP (.stp, .step), IGES (.igs, .iges), SolidWorks (.sldprt), AutoCAD (.dwg, .dxf), and PDF drawings. If you have files in other formats, please contact us to confirm compatibility."
  - question: "What production volumes do you handle?"
    answer: "We specialize in prototype to medium-volume production runs. This includes single prototypes for design validation, small batches (10-500 pieces), and medium production runs (500+ pieces). We focus on providing personalized service regardless of quantity."
  - question: "What materials can you machine?"
    answer: "We work with a wide range of materials including aluminum alloys (6061, 7075, 2024), stainless steels (303, 304, 316, 17-4 PH), engineering plastics (Delrin, PEEK, Ultem, Nylon), and specialty alloys (Titanium, Inconel, Brass). Contact us for specific material requirements not listed."
  - question: "What tolerances can you achieve?"
    answer: "We routinely achieve tolerances as tight as Â±0.001\" on critical dimensions. Our capabilities include positional tolerances, geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T), and surface finish requirements. Specific tolerances depend on part geometry, material, and machining process."
  - question: "Do you provide Design for Manufacturability (DFM) feedback?"
    answer: "Yes! DFM collaboration is a core part of our service. Our experienced machinists review your designs and provide recommendations to improve manufacturability, reduce costs, and enhance quality without compromising functionality. This collaborative approach often results in better parts at lower costs."
  - question: "What are your quality control and inspection procedures?"
    answer: "Every part undergoes rigorous quality inspection using precision measurement equipment including CMM (Coordinate Measuring Machine). We provide first article inspection reports for initial parts and maintain statistical process control throughout production. All work is performed to ISO quality standards."
  - question: "Can you work with materials that I supply?"
    answer: "Yes, we can work with customer-supplied materials. We'll need material certifications and specifications to ensure proper machining parameters. Please note that we cannot guarantee material quality for customer-supplied stock, and additional setup time may be required."
  - question: "What are your payment terms?"
    answer: "For new customers, we typically require 50% payment upon order placement and 50% upon completion. For established customers with approved credit, we offer Net 30 payment terms. We accept wire transfers, ACH, checks, and major credit cards."
  - question: "Do you provide assembly services?"
    answer: "While our primary focus is precision machining, we can provide basic assembly services for multi-component projects. Complex assemblies are typically handled by our network of trusted partners. Contact us to discuss your specific assembly requirements."
  - question: "How do you handle proprietary designs and confidentiality?"
    answer: "We take confidentiality very seriously. All customer designs and proprietary information are protected under strict non-disclosure agreements. Our team is experienced in working with sensitive aerospace, medical, and commercial applications requiring the highest levels of confidentiality."
