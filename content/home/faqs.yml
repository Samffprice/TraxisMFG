faqs:
  - question: "What is your typical lead time for a project?"
    answer: "Our standard production timeline is typically 6 weeks from design approval to delivery. This allows us to dedicate the necessary time and attention to detail that high-precision components demand. For urgent requirements, expedited service may be available depending on project complexity and current capacity."
  - question: "What tolerances can you achieve?"
    answer: "We routinely achieve tolerances as tight as Â±0.001\" on critical dimensions. Our capabilities include positional tolerances, geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T), and surface finish requirements. Specific tolerances depend on part geometry, material, and machining process."
  - question: "What materials can you machine?"
    answer: "We work with a wide range of materials including aluminum alloys (6061, 7075, 2024), stainless steels (303, 304, 316, 17-4 PH), engineering plastics (Delrin, PEEK, Ultem, Nylon), and specialty alloys (Titanium, Inconel, Brass). Contact us for specific material requirements not listed."
  - question: "What production volumes do you handle?"
    answer: "We specialize in prototype to medium-volume production runs. This includes single prototypes for design validation, small batches (10-500 pieces), and medium production runs (500+ pieces). We focus on providing personalized service regardless of quantity."
  - question: "Do you provide Design for Manufacturability (DFM) feedback?"
    answer: "Yes! DFM collaboration is a core part of our service. Our experienced machinists review your designs and provide recommendations to improve manufacturability, reduce costs, and enhance quality without compromising functionality. This collaborative approach often results in better parts at lower costs."
  - question: "What are your quality control and inspection procedures?"
    answer: "Every part undergoes rigorous quality inspection using precision measurement equipment including CMM (Coordinate Measuring Machine). We provide first article inspection reports for initial parts and maintain statistical process control throughout production. All work is performed to ISO quality standards."
