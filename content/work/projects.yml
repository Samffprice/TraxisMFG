    challenge: "The client approached Traxis with a critical component for their next-generation analysis machine. Their previous supplier struggled to consistently produce the complex aluminum manifold, which featured multiple intersecting bores and required positional tolerances of ±0.001\". This inconsistency was causing assembly delays and jeopardizing the product launch."
    solution: "Our engineering team immediately initiated a Design for Manufacturability (DFM) review. We collaborated with the client's engineers to suggest minor, non-functional design modifications that would improve tool access and ensure greater stability during machining. The part was then programmed for our 5-axis CNC mill, allowing us to machine all critical features in a single setup."
    results: 
      - "Achieved and maintained a part acceptance rate of over 99.8% across production runs"
      - "Eliminated the client's assembly line fitment issues, reducing their final assembly time by an estimated 15%"
      - "Successfully delivered the initial prototype run and subsequent medium-volume production orders on schedule"
